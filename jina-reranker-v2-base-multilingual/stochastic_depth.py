    Implements the Stochastic Depth from `"Deep Networks with Stochastic Depth"
    <https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.09382>`_ used for randomly dropping residual
    branches of residual architectures.

    Args:
        input (Tensor[N, ...]): The input tensor or arbitrary dimensions with the first one
                    being its batch i.e. a batch with ``N`` rows.
        p (float): probability of the input to be zeroed.
        mode (str): ``"batch"`` or ``"row"``.
                    ``"batch"`` randomly zeroes the entire input, ``"row"`` zeroes
                    randomly selected rows from the batch.
        training: apply stochastic depth if is ``True``. Default: ``True``

    Returns:
        Tensor[N, ...]: The randomly zeroed tensor.
